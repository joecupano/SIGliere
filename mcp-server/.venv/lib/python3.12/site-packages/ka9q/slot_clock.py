"""SlotClock — epoch-aligned slot boundaries in GPS-true RTP-timestamp space.

The canonical, drift-immune timing primitive shared by every sigmond slot/
period recorder (psk-recorder FT8/FT4, wspr-recorder WSPR/FST4W, hfdl, …).
It exists because clients kept re-implementing slot timing on top of a
*delivered-sample-count* projection, which silently drifts: if the receive
path ever over- or under-counts samples relative to real time (gap-fill
accounting, a late anchor, a dropped burst the resequencer mis-sizes), the
projected UTC runs ahead of or behind the actual RF, the WAV gets a label
that doesn't match its content, and decode_ft8/wsprd align to the wrong grid
point → zero decodes on perfectly good audio.  A self-check built from the
same delivered-count can't catch this — both sides move together.

The fix, and this class's whole premise: **drive boundaries from the RTP
timestamp radiod stamps on every packet.**  radiod's RTP counter is
GPS/PPS-disciplined and advances by exactly one per output sample of real
time, regardless of what the client's delivery bookkeeping does.  So:

  * Anchor ONCE: map a single RTP timestamp to UTC via ``rtp_to_utc``
    (the §18/METROLOGY RTP-reference rule — the only wall-clock-ish read).
  * Every slot boundary is an epoch-aligned UTC instant (a multiple of the
    cadence: FT8 :00/:15/:30/:45, FT4 every 7.5 s, WSPR every 120 s) whose
    RTP timestamp is computed by integer arithmetic from the anchor.
  * A slot is *complete* once the stream's latest RTP timestamp has passed
    the slot's end (plus a small settle).  The sample window to extract is
    expressed in RTP units, so it's immune to delivered-count drift.
  * ``cadence_sec * sample_rate`` must be an integer number of samples
    (true for every real mode: 15·12000, 7.5·12000, 120·12000, …), so
    boundary-to-boundary stepping is exact integer arithmetic — no float
    accumulation.

RTP timestamps are unsigned 32-bit and wrap (~99 h at 12 kHz, ~16 h at
64 kHz IQ).  All differences use Phil Karn's signed-32 technique so a wrap
is just normal arithmetic.  Absolute RTP positions are tracked as an
unwrapped 64-bit count off the anchor: a monotonic high-water offset is
carried, and every wrapped timestamp is unwrapped *relative to that
high-water* (not relative to the anchor).  This is what makes the offset
correct for streams that run arbitrarily long past their anchor — a raw
``anchor``-relative signed-32 diff would alias once the stream is more than
2**31 samples (~49.7 h @ 12 kHz, ~9.3 h @ 64 kHz IQ) from the anchor, at
which point ``advance`` would silently stop harvesting slots.  All real
queries (the latest timestamp, a just-passed boundary) are within one slot
of the high-water, so the unwrap is unambiguous.

This class is pure timing logic — it owns no socket, ring, or thread.  The
caller feeds it RTP timestamps and asks which slots are now complete.
